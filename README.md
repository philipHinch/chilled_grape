# Chilled Grape

This project is for a Web Developer Test. I had to create a web page in line with one of the designs. It was required to fetch data from an API endpoint and display the data in the response.

### Quick description:

**Chilled Grape** will allow you to click on each of the card locations and show you their exact address on the globe in the **Mapbox** feature. Clicking the hamburger icon, on small and medium screens, will allow a sliding menu to appear with all the navbar links and the login button. Clicking on the close button or on the dark overlay will close the sliding menu.

### Technologies used:

- React
- React Hooks
- High Order Functions (Map, Filter)
- Fetch API
- Async/Await (Asyncronous Programming)
- Mapbox GL JS
- CSS Animations
- CSS Variables

Note: 
&nbsp;
I chose to use **React** rather than **Vanilla JavaScript** because of how smooth **React** applications are and how easy it is to insert HTML elements with JSX instead of the long process of creating elements an appending text and classes to them with plain JS.

### Challenges:

- The hero background implementation was quite tricky. I could not download the image with all the assets as one image so I had to insert every single blob iamge inside the hero container with CSS and position them correctly while making sure that they also looked good on smaller screens.

### What extra features can be added:

- Create routing to switch between pages. 
- Add an extra page for the products.
- Toast notification with error message when app encounters an error.
